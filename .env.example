# Load-balancing strategy: least-requests | round-robin | session | weighted | weighted-round-robin
# - least-requests: Route to account with fewest requests (default)
# - round-robin: Distribute requests evenly across all accounts
# - session: Maintain 5-hour sessions per account
# - weighted: Route based on tier-adjusted request count (respects 1x, 5x, 20x tiers)
# - weighted-round-robin: Round-robin that gives more slots to higher tier accounts
LB_STRATEGY=least-requests

# Log level: DEBUG | INFO | WARN | ERROR (optional, defaults to INFO)
LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# Log format: pretty | json (optional, defaults to pretty)
# - pretty: Human-readable format with timestamps
# - json: Structured JSON logs for log aggregators

# Example of how to use the proxy with your application:
# Without SSL:

# With SSL:
